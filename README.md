# WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY D682 - AI OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPUTER SCIENTISTS

A.  Create your subgroup and project in GitLab using the "GitLab" web link and the "GitLab FAQ File" web link by doing the following:

•   Clone the project to the IDE.

•   Commit with a message and push when you complete each requirement listed in parts B1, B2, B3, C1, and C2.



Note: You may commit and push whenever you want to back up your changes, even if a requirement is not yet complete.



•   Submit a copy of the GitLab repository URL in the "Comments to Evaluator" section when you submit this assessment.

•   Submit a copy of the repository branch history retrieved from your repository, which must include the commit messages and dates.



Note: Wait until you have completed all the following prompts before you create your copy of the repository branch history.



B.  Implement optimization, regularization, and ensemble learning techniques on your AI model developed in Task 1 by doing the following:

1.  Apply two optimization techniques suitable for your AI model.

2.  Apply two regularization methods suitable for your AI model.

3.  Apply two ensemble learning techniques suitable for your AI model.



C.  Evaluate your optimized AI model's performance by doing the following:

1.  Apply at least two evaluation metrics that are suitable for your optimized AI model.

2.  Compare your AI model's performance before and after optimization based on the evaluation metrics results in part C1.



D.  Write a narrative report about optimizing your AI model developed in Task 1 by doing the following:

1.  Explain why the two optimization techniques applied in part B1 were chosen.

2.  Explain why the two regularization methods applied in part B2 were chosen.

3.  Explain why the two ensemble learning techniques applied in part B3 were chosen.

4.  Explain why the two evaluation metrics applied in part C1 were chosen.

5.  Summarize the analysis from part C2 by providing insights into the implications for model performance and business study impact.



E.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.



F.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
