# WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY D682 - AI OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPUTER SCIENTISTS

## A. GitLab Repository

Create your subgroup and project in GitLab using the "GitLab" web link and the "GitLab FAQ File" web link by doing the following:

- Clone the project to the IDE.
- Commit with a message and push when you complete each requirement listed in parts C1, C2, D2, and D3.

> **Note:** You may commit and push whenever you want to back up your changes, even if a requirement is not yet complete.

- Submit a copy of the GitLab repository URL in the "Comments to Evaluator" section when you submit this assessment.
- Submit a copy of the repository branch history retrieved from your repository, which must include the commit messages and dates.

> **Note:** Wait until you have completed all the following prompts before you create your copy of the repository branch history.

## B. Evaluate AI Algorithms

Research a minimum of three AI algorithms that are suitable for addressing the optimization problem detailed in the attached "DQN1 Case Study" and data provided in the attached “DQN1 Dataset.” Write a detailed narrative report that describes the three algorithms and justifies your selected algorithm by doing the following:

1. Describe three AI algorithms that you considered in your research.

2. Determine which algorithm you will use for the remainder of the task, and provide a justification by doing the following:
    - a. Describe how the selected algorithm relates to the specified optimization problem.
    - b. Describe at least two strengths of the selected algorithm in addressing the specified optimization problem.
    - c. Describe at least two potential limitations of the selected algorithm in addressing the specified optimization problem.

## C. Implement

Implement your selected algorithm by doing the following:

1. Use Python, the appropriate framework, and comments in your code to explain both the process and the flow of the program.
2. Push functional code to a GitLab repository and submit the URL in the "Comments to Evaluator" section when you submit this assessment.

## D. Test and Validate

Test and validate the algorithm by doing the following:

1. Identify two evaluation metrics that are appropriate for your chosen algorithm to assess its performance. Document these evaluation metrics in the narrative report you created in part B of this task.
2. Implement the evaluation metrics from part D1 and provide the results in your GitLab repository from part C2.
3. Analyze the evaluation metrics results from part D2 and document your analysis in the narrative report from part B.
4. Describe at least one area for improvement based on your evaluation from part D2. Include your response in the narrative report from part B.

## E. Sources and Citations

Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

## F. Professional Communication

Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
